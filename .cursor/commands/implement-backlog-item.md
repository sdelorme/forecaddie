You are implementing ONE backlog item end-to-end.

1. Ask: which backlog checkbox (copy/paste the exact line) and which files are involved.
2. Produce a mini plan:
   - affected routes/components
   - data layer changes (queries/mappers/schemas)
   - loading/error states
3. Implement with minimal diff size.
4. Ensure:
   - server components by default
   - no DataGolf calls from UI
   - runtime validation added if new endpoint
5. Finish with:
   - “How to test locally”
   - any follow-up TODOs added to BACKLOG.md
