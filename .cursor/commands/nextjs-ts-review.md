Use the “Forecaddie Next.js + TypeScript Best Practices Reviewer” skill.

Review the selected files and/or recent diff for:

- App Router correctness (server/client boundaries)
- data flow layering (queries/mappers/types)
- runtime validation coverage
- caching and performance red flags
- security concerns (secrets, headers, input validation)

Output:
Must-fix issues (with file paths)
Suggestions (with small diffs)
Perf notes
