# Forecaddie: project context

Forecaddie is a golf statistics + live tournament tracking app built with Next.js (App Router), React, and TypeScript.

Product intent:

- A user-friendly wrapper over the DataGolf API (PGA Tour scope).
- Betting companion for One-and-Done leagues: users plan picks per tournament; each golfer can only be used once per season.
- Strategy-focused: users can build multiple planning scenarios using historical data and odds.
- Future: shared accounts / multiple users per workspace.

Tech baseline:

- Next.js App Router. Server Components by default.
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui components.
- DataGolf API calls must go through `src/lib/api/datagolf/*` only.
- Use `@/` imports.
- Style: no semicolons, single quotes, no trailing commas (Prettier enforced).

Repo structure reference:

- `src/app/*` routes (App Router)
- `src/lib/api/datagolf/` client/config/queries/mappers/types
- `src/components/*` UI and shared components

Operational commands:

- `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`

When in doubt:

- Prefer correctness + clarity over cleverness.
- If introducing a new domain concept, define it in `docs/CONTEXT.md`.
